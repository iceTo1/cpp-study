# Custom List Implementation (C++)

This repository contains a complete implementation of a doubly-linked list, modeled after `std::list`.

## Features
- Doubly linked structure with `prev` and `next` pointers
- STL-compatible iterator types:
  - `iterator`, `const_iterator`
  - `reverse_iterator`, `const_reverse_iterator`
- Support for bidirectional iteration
- Efficient insertion and deletion at any position
- Clear, insert, erase, push/pop front and back

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to internalize the core principles of `std::list` and become comfortable with pointer manipulation, list traversal, and custom iterator design.

> Iterator safety and const-correctness were emphasized.  
> Future plans include integrating allocator support.
