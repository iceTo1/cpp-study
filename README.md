# cpp-study

This is my personal C++ study repository.

It includes custom implementations of STL-like components, algorithm practice, and more.

I am currently studying Computer Engineering at the University of Utah.
In addition to what I learn in class, I use this space to explore my own interests and deepen my understanding of C++ through hands-on implementation.


## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to reinforce my C++ skills beyond the classroom by:
- Rebuilding STL-like components from scratch
- Practicing algorithms and time complexity analysis
- Exploring topics such as function pointers, lambda expressions, and iterators


## Whatâ€™s Inside

- Custom `vector<T>` implementation
- Custom `list<T>` implementation
- Custom `iterator` header implementation
- Custom `allocator` implementation, adapted to custom containers
- Custom `Binary Search Tree` implementation
- Custom `AVL Tree` implementation
- Custom `Min/Max Heap Tree` implementation
- Custom `algorithm` header implementation
- Custom `functional` header implementation
- Custom `utility` header implementation
- Custom `type_traits` header implementation

- Custom `cout`, `cin`, `endl` implementation

- Leetcode problem solutions with description
(More content will be added.)


## Getting Started

You can clone this repository with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/remydzn/cpp-study.git
```
All files are written and tested using Visual Studio on Windows.


## Feedback Welcome

If you have suggestions, improvements, or critiques, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.  
I am currently studying and always looking to improve my understanding of C++ best practices.
